Swift Mailer
------------

**Redrock is now maintaining Swiftmailer. We are actively working to integrate features from Symfony Mailer back into Swiftmailer.**

Swiftmailer, which was originally scheduled to stop being maintained at the end of November 2021, has found new life under Redrock. Our goal is to ensure that Swiftmailer remains a robust, modern mailing solution for PHP developers by incorporating the latest features and improvements from Symfony Mailer.

We recognize that many legacy and enterprise applications with significant technical debt cannot easily switch to Symfony Mailer. These applications may prioritize backwards compatibility and simplicity over adopting the latest best practices for PHP namespaces and other modern standards. By continuing to maintain and enhance Swiftmailer, we aim to provide a stable and familiar solution that meets the needs of these applications, ensuring they can continue to operate effectively without major overhauls.

Swift Mailer is a component-based mailing solution for PHP, released under the MIT license. It is highly object-oriented by design, making it flexible and suitable for complex web applications.

For full details on usage, read the [documentation](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/docs/introduction.html).

Stay tuned for updates as we enhance Swiftmailer with new features and capabilities.
